## Description
This application is useful while working at a custom frame shop to calculate total frame size, prices, and taxes.
This Application is currently in a prototype phase, as it is being tested in its current form on a tablet in the shop. Features in development include the ability to change hardcoded variables in a settings tab and add a reset/clear all button.
